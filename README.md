Yes, one of the primary inventors of rapid-fire weaponry, Dr. Richard Jordan Gatling, explicitly stated that his intention in creating his eponymous gun was to help stop war or at least make it less deadly. Richard Gatling's Vision Gatling, a physician during the American Civil War, witnessed the high death rates of soldiers, most of whom died from disease and exposure rather than actual battle wounds. He reasoned that a powerful, rapid-fire gun could change the nature of conflict: Reduce Army Size: Gatling believed that if one man with his machine could do the work of a hundred soldiers, large armies would become unnecessary. Diminish Casualties: By requiring fewer men on the battlefield, overall exposure to disease and combat would be "greatly diminished," thereby saving lives. Deterrence: He hoped the sheer destructive power of the weapon would make the prospect of war so horrifying and futile that nations would be discouraged from fighting in the first place. The Reality Gatling's humanitarian vision did not come to pass. Instead, rapid-fire weapons like the Gatling gun and the later, fully automatic Maxim gun (invented by Hiram Maxim, who was also motivated by a similar "end war" philosophy, or at least commercial opportunity for a "killing machine") drastically increased the death toll in conflicts. The introduction of the machine gun in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to devastating results, especially during World War I, where they were responsible for a massive percentage of casualties and dictated the defensive nature of trench warfare. The idea that making war more terrible would prevent it is a recurring theme among some weapon inventors, including Alfred Nobel (inventor of dynamite) and Nikola Tesla (who proposed a powerful "death ray" as a defensive "peace ray"), but history has shown that new destructive technologies tend to change the tactics of war rather than eliminate the conflict itself.
